Normalization explanation
The Normalization method are strewn from a design preventing a parry (ward off) like data base. Whereas the data base information you enter alludes, repetitive logging. The normalization faults occur when the data another person enters gives iterating (repeated word) information. 
For exemplar. Another model of a car or VIN number is repeated in other sectionâ€¦all the while your updating information it could cause confusion building a data base and the information afore sits in another section of the data base giving a jobbery (corruption) situation.
